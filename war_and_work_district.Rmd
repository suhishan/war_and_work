### Collapse the huge nlfs dataset into the district level.

```{r}
nlfs_grouped <- nlfs %>% group_by(district_abbrev, nlfs_year) %>% 
  summarize(
   across(
     .cols = -c(district_name, psu),
     .fns = list(
       mean = ~ round(mean(.x, na.rm = T), 3),
       sd = ~ round(sd(.x, na.rm = T), 3)
     ),
     .names = "{.fn}_{.col}"
   ),
   sample_w = n()
  ) %>% 
  ungroup()

```

### Merge this with the conflict dataset.

```{r}
nlfs_grouped_c <- left_join(nlfs_grouped, c_collapsed_2,
                            by = c("district_abbrev"))
# We do not have Mustang's conflict data, so it will remain as NA for now.

```

### Output district collapsed data into a file

```{r}
write_csv(nlfs_grouped_c, file = "Data/nlfs_district.csv")
```
